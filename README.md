Hey |ʘ‿ʘ)╯, I am Srijit Mukherjee.

# Introduction 
I am a doctoral student in the Electrical Engineering Department at the Pennsylvania State University. I am working on brain images to build cost-effective explainable intelligent algorithms to detect a specific kind of infection inside the brain. I share my knowledge in deep learning to help learners build their skills. I enjoy solving problems with data, mathematics, probability, and programming. Currently, I am interested in applications of machine learning in medicine, biology, and healthcare. Let me give you a short background of mine.

# Background
I've built a strong foundation in mathematics and problem-solving through my school days and the Mathematics Olympiad, honed my skills in statistics and machine learning at the Indian Statistical Institute, and gained valuable teaching and entrepreneurial experience at Cheenta Academy. Currently, as a PhD student at Pennsylvania State University, I am deepening my expertise in deep learning and computational methods. My long-term vision is to create a sustainable and interpretable AI ecosystem that bridges academic research and industrial problem-solving. You can more about my learning journey [here](https://mukherjeesrijit.substack.com/about), and my professional experience here on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srijit-mukherjee/). 

# Passion Projects
* **Competitive Problem Solving** I solve competitive mathematics, probability, and programming problems [here](https://github.com/mukherjeesrijit/problem-solving) for fun, regularly.
* **Content Creation** I enjoy writing content that inspires or helps one to understand and solve problems in machine learning, and its applications [here](https://github.com/mukherjeesrijit/content-resources), [substack](https://mukherjeesrijit.substack.com/), and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@mukherjeesrijit).
* **Data Science Projects** I also share my insights into data science projects by either doing real data-based projects or coding machine learning / deep learning algorithms from scratch for pedagogical purposes [here](https://github.com/mukherjeesrijit/data-science-projects).
* **Courses and Talks** I share my knowledge in live courses and talks. You can find all the live talks [here](https://github.com/mukherjeesrijit/courses-talks).
