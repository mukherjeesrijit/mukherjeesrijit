Hey |ʘ‿ʘ)╯ I am Srijit. I am a Ph.D. student in the EECS Department at Pennsylvania State University. I am working on brain images to build cost-effective, explainable intelligent algorithms to detect a specific kind of infection inside the brain. My research interest is building domain-enriched and explainable AI solutions in biomedical imaging. When I get bored with medical imaging data, I dabble around with simple yet complex financial data for fun.
