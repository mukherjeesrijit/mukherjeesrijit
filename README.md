Hey |ʘ‿ʘ)╯ I am Srijit. I am a Ph.D. student in the EECS Department at Pennsylvania State University. I am working on brain images to build cost-effective, explainable intelligent algorithms to detect a specific kind of infection inside the brain. My research interest is building domain-enriched and explainable AI solutions in biomedical imaging in resource-constrained settings. When I get bored with medical imaging data, I dabble around with simple yet complex financial data for fun.

I meditate on mathematics, algorithms, and data science. I share the acquired knowledge through content and research, with the firm belief that the learners will gradually imbibe the process of meditating on it in their own way, with curiosity and creativity.
