Hey |ʘ‿ʘ)╯, I am Srijit. I am a Ph.D student in the EECS Department at the Pennsylvania State University. I am working on brain images to build cost-effective explainable intelligent algorithms to detect a specific kind of infection inside the brain for hydrocephalic infants. My research interest is building custom domain-enriched and explainable AI solutions for medical imaging. When I get bored with medical imaging data, I dabble around with simple yet so complex financial data for fun.

I firmly believe that if one spends time with a subject devotes oneself to it, and has strong foundations. good problem-solving skills, a bit of creative spark, and a tinge of communication skills, one can easily earn a comfortable living while spending quality time with one's subject of interest, with one's art. With this belief, I have been enjoying building a data science/statistics community since 2020 and love to share my knowledge back to the community by teaching or creating content online. In the process, I have been fortunate to have met some beautiful minds, and look forward to meeting more.

* if leisure: I teach. else: I learn OR I build.
