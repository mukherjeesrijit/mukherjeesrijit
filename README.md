I have been meditating on data science and its foundations, since 2010. I share the acquired knowledge through teaching, and research with a firm belief that reading the learners will gradually imbibe the process of meditating on the same, in their unique way with curiosity, and creativity. I give my best to help the learners understand what thinking process of interrogation, and curiosity that went into the same. I hope the students can replicate the process in their unique way, in their mind space, and enjoy the outcome.
