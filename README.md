Hey |ʘ‿ʘ)╯, I am Srijit. I am a Ph.D student in the EECS Department at the Pennsylvania State University. I am working on brain images to build cost-effective explainable intelligent algorithms to detect a specific kind of infection inside the brain. My research interest lies in exploring domain-enriched and explainable AI solutions for various data modalities (current interest: medical imaging). I am usually in one of the three phases at any given moment: Learn, Teach, or Build. The following are the significant compounding effects of dedicated efforts over a longer time frame.

### Build(ing):
* (Research) Explainable Deep Learning-based Computer Vision Algorithms for Hydrocephalic Patients using Low Field MRI with Limited Low-quality Data
* (Startup) Cheenta Statistics and Data Science for guiding learners in non-routine problem-solving for MSc Stat / DS entrances in India and building data science projects

### Teach(ing):
Over the years, I have taught and created content for thousands of students in  
* competitive problem-solving for the mathematics olympiad and MSc. Stat / DS entrances in India
* mathematics, probability, statistics, data science, and guided data science projects

### Learn(ing):
I have built my strong academic background in 
* deep learning, and computational methods at [the Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/)
* mathematics, probability, statistics, and machine learning at the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/)
* competitive math problem-solving for the mathematics olympiad in my school days
