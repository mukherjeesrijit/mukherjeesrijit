Hey |ʘ‿ʘ)╯, I am Srijit. I am a Ph.D student in the EECS Department at the Pennsylvania State University. I am working on brain images to build cost-effective explainable intelligent algorithms to detect a specific kind of infection inside the brain for hydrocephalic infants. My research interest is building custom domain-enriched and explainable AI solutions for medical imaging. When I get bored with medical imaging data, I dabble around with simple yet so complex financial data for fun.

if leisure: I teach. else: I learn OR I build.
