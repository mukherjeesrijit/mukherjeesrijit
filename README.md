Hey |ʘ‿ʘ)╯, I am Srijit. I am a Ph.D student in the EECS Department at the Pennsylvania State University. I am working on brain images to build cost-effective explainable intelligent algorithms to detect a specific kind of infection inside the brain. My research interest lies in building domain-enriched and explainable AI solutions in medical imaging.
