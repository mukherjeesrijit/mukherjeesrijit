Hey |ʘ‿ʘ)╯, I am Srijit. I am a Ph.D student in the EECS Department at the Pennsylvania State University. I am working on brain images to build cost-effective explainable intelligent algorithms to detect a specific kind of infection inside the brain for hydrocephalic infants. My research interest is building custom domain-enriched and explainable AI solutions for medical imaging. When I get bored with medical imaging data, I dabble around with simple yet so complex financial data for fun.

I meditate on mathematics, algorithms, and data science. I share the acquired knowledge through content and research, with the firm belief that the learners will gradually imbibe the process of meditating on the same, in their way with curiosity, and creativity.
