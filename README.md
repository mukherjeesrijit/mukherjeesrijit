Hey |ʘ‿ʘ)╯, I am Srijit Mukherjee. I am currently working on brain images to build cost-effective explainable intelligent algorithms to detect a specific kind of infection inside the brain.

Interest: Broadly, I am interested in applications of machine learning and computational algorithms in medicine, biology, and healthcare (currently: medical imaging).

**Introduction**:I share my knowledge in deep learning to help learners build their skills.  Let me give you a short background of mine. I enjoy solving problems with data, mathematics, probability, and programming.


**Background**: Presently, I am a doctoral student in the Electrical Engineering Department at the Pennsylvania State University. Over the years, I've been fortunate to have built a strong foundation in mathematics and problem-solving through my school days and the Mathematics Olympiad, honed my skills in statistics and machine learning at the Indian Statistical Institute, and gained valuable teaching and entrepreneurial experience at Cheenta Academy. Currently, as a PhD student at Pennsylvania State University, I am deepening my expertise in deep learning and computational methods. My long-term vision is to create a sustainable and interpretable AI ecosystem that bridges academic research and industrial problem-solving in medical AI. You can more about my learning journey [here](https://mukherjeesrijit.substack.com/about), and my academic and professional experiences here on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srijit-mukherjee/). Feel free to get in touch with me on LinkedIn.
